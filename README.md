### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rami James and I'm a designer, product specialist, and developer.

I write a lot about software, leadership, and parenting.

Some of my more popular pieces are:

- [Asking for help is a core developer skill](https://www.ramijames.com/thoughts/asking-for-help-is-a-core-skill)
- [Package dependency hell](https://www.ramijames.com/thoughts/package-dependency-hell)
- [Docs deserve more respect](https://www.ramijames.com/thoughts/docs-deserve-more-respect)

## Say hello!

I'm actively seeking design and front-end projects, so reach out to [rami@ramijames.com](mailto:rami@ramijames.com) or say hello on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ramijames)

## Current Projects

Typically, I am working on many things concurrently. I also like to read three or four books at the same time. It's just how my mind works.

Right now I'm focused on building:

- [ramijames.com](https://www.ramijames.com/) - My personal website
- [CrispTools](https://crisptools.dev/) - CrispTools is a set of free online tools for designers and developers
- [Random Sandwich](https://random-sandwich.com/) - A blow-off-steam project that keeps me amused

## Tech Stack
The core technologies that I use to create my works are:

- Front-end: Vue or Nuxt
- Auth: Firebase or Okta
- Backend: Express
- Database: Postgres or CouchDB
- Deployment: Netlify or Digital Ocean

These days I work primarily in Javascript, but have used Ruby and PHP in the past.
